# Dependencies of the Gemfile.lock
#
# While `Gemfile.lock` is often committed to ensure consistent dependency
# versions across environments, some prefer to ignore it for simple sites
# or local development. For a Jekyll project that will be deployed (e.g., GitHub Pages),
# it's generally recommended to *include* Gemfile.lock.
# If you want to ignore it, uncomment the line below:
# Gemfile.lock
