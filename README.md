# LLM360 |  Open-source LLMs for Transparency, Trust, and Collaborative Research ðŸš€

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for LLM360's website. This project is dedicated to open-sourcing Large Language Models (LLMs) to promote transparency, trust, and collaborative research in the AI community.

## Introduction
LLM360 aims to redefine open-source in machine learning by providing unprecedented access to the entire training process of LLMs. We release all the intermediate checkpoints, training data, source code, logs, and metrics associated with each model.

This repository builds llm360.ai.
