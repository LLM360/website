# LLM360: Fully Transparent Open Source LLMs

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for LLM360's website, a collaborative initiative between Petuum, MBZUAI, and Cerebras. This project is dedicated to open-sourcing Large Language Models (LLMs) to promote transparency, trust, and collaborative research in the AI community.

## Introduction
LLM360 aims to redefine open-source in machine learning by providing unprecedented access to the entire training process of LLMs. We release all the intermediate checkpoints, training data, source code, logs, and metrics associated with each model. Our first releases under this initiative are the Amber-7B and CrystalCoder-7B models.

## Models
### Amber-7B
- **Details**: Trained on 1.2 trillion tokens, Amber-7B offers insights into the learning dynamics of LLMs.
- **Resources**:
  - [Model](https://huggingface.co/LLM360/Amber)
  - [Metrics](https://wandb.ai/llm360/Amber)
  - [Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM360/AmberDatasets)
  - [Code](https://github.com/orgs/LLM360/repositories/Amber)

### CrystalCoder-7B
- **Details**: A unique model combining text and coding capabilities, trained on 1.4 trillion tokens.
- **Resources**:
  - [Model](https://huggingface.co/LLM360/CrystalCoder)
  - [Metrics](https://wandb.ai/llm360/CrystalCoder)
  - [Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM360/CrystalCoderDatasets)
  - [Code](https://github.com/orgs/LLM360/repositories/CrystalCoder)

## Community and Collaboration
