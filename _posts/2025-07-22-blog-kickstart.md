## Welcome to the LLM360 Blog!

Hey everyone! Welcome to the very first post on our new blog. We're super excited to kick things off and share a little bit about what you can expect here.

This blog is all about showcasing the small, fun, and quick experiment results from the LLM360 team. We'll be posting our latest findings, interesting observations, and maybe even some unexpected twists from our work with large language models. Think of it as a behind-the-scenes look at our playful side of LLM research.

And here's the kicker: we're all about full transparency. That means we're willing to share anything from our pretraining effortsâ€”even the failures or "secrets" other pretrainers might keep under wraps. Our goal is to give you a truly unfiltered look at what it takes to work with LLMs.

We aim to keep these posts concise, engaging, and easy to digest. So, if you're curious about the nitty-gritty (and often quirky) details of LLM experiments, you've come to the right place.

Stay tuned for more!
